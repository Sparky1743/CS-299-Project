We have Built a machine learning model to detect and analyze specific regions in signals that correspond to plant wound responses.

This project delves into the interdisciplinary realm of biology, electrical engineering, and computer science to explore and understand the electrophysiological responses of tobacco plants to stimuli, particularly wound-induced variation potentials. The endeavor involved the cultivation of tobacco plants, the development of an electrophysiological measurement device, and the use of a DAQ system for data collection. Despite challenges faced in the physical realization of the device, experiments were conducted to measure variation potentials resulting from plant wounding. Subsequently, collected data were processed and analyzed using signal processing techniques, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was developed to identify regions within the signals corresponding to plant wound responses. This project serves as an interdisciplinary approach, demonstrating the integration of experimental biology, electrical engineering, and computational methods to study and interpret plant electrophysiology.
