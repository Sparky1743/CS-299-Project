# Machine Learning Based Plant Electrophysiological Signal Study: CS299 Project

This repository encompasses an interdisciplinary project conducted as part of the CS299 course in the 3rd semester. The project aimed to delve into the electrophysiological responses of tobacco plants, specifically focusing on wound-induced variation potentials, by integrating machine learning, plant physiology, and signal processing.

## Project Highlights

### Interdisciplinary Exploration
- Explored electrophysiological responses of tobacco plants to stimuli.
- Integrated machine learning, plant physiology, and signal processing methodologies.
- Targeted understanding variation potentials induced by plant injuries.

### Signal Processing and Machine Learning
- Utilized signal measurements and processing techniques for plant electrical data.
- Developed a precise Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based ML algorithm.
- Algorithm accurately detects the onset of plant injury and assesses variation potential duration.

### Course Context
This project was completed as part of the CS299 course, focusing on interdisciplinary applications in the 3rd semester. It stands as an example of combining multiple disciplines to understand plant behavior and electrical responses to stimuli.
